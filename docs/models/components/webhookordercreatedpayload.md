* A customer starts a subscription. In this case, `billing_reason` is set to `subscription_create`.
* A subscription is renewed. In this case, `billing_reason` is set to `subscription_cycle`.
* A subscription is upgraded or downgraded with an immediate proration invoice. In this case, `billing_reason` is set to `subscription_update`.
